# Tetris Game
## _A Tetris Game made entirely with JS_

This project was coded between 12/23/2023 and 12/26/2023 by José Antônio Belquior Gomes.
It was made from scratch. I was hyped by the movie, I confess.

To experience, simply open the index.html in a modern browser.

## Instructions

- Space: starts game
- left, right and down arrows: moves the pieces through the board
- z: imediatlly sets the piece into it`s final destination (final straight position)
